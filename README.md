lines 19-59:

I added a function for password options. Within this function I applied if statements and alerts and arrays with strings for the user to choose whether they would want numbers,letters(uppercase or lower),special characters, and added a prompt to alert the user as well if they chose a number of charcters under 8 or over 128. This was followed by a var with password options confriming after they did or did not choose a type of character to be featured in the generated password.
